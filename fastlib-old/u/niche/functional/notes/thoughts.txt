three methods for approaching ICA with consideration for time series:


1) Temporal ICA with smoothing

Consider spatial mixing model X = A*S

X = N x T
A = N x N
S = N x T

the distribution of each x is not necessarily independent of the distribution of any other other x
the distribution of each s is independent of the distribution of each other s

spatial dimensions correspond to multivariate data
goal is to unmix multivariate data into new independent distributions

there is some temporal structure in the data
smooth the data X over time


2) ICA where each observation is a T-dimensional data point

X = A * S

X = T x N
A = T x T
S = T x N

dot product of two data points does not produce a zero
if we can find some mapping of the data points onto an independent basis

we are unaware of how many independent components truly underly the data


given N observations, it is possible to recover no more than N components
we often care to recover less components

the process we actually consider should be some mixing process with noise


assume N observations
each observation is some superposition of temporal patterns
these temporal patterns occur in each observation independently



suppose we have recovered N' principle components that account for most of the variance of our data
thus, we have e set
We can then consider rotations of these principal components



      

PCA provides a transformation on the loadings of the components that maximizes the amount of variance accounted for by each component

ICA provides a transformation on the loadings of the components that maximizes the statistical independence in the distributions of the loadings of the components
