Installation Instructions
=================================

The recommended installation method is to use GODI (not yet implemented),
which automatically downloads and installs for you. The directions
below are needed only if you are not using GODI.

First, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
   
   ocaml
   findlib (for installation only)
   ocamldsort (for installation only)
   ...

Assuming you have all the prerequisites installed, compile the code
by typing

   make all

Then, install the code by typing

   make install (not yet implemented)

This step will require root permission if your ocaml distribution is
installed in a system directory. Finally, to make documentation do

   make doc

The root of the documentation is doc/html/index.html.
