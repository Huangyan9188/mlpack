	- Meeting(12/2 Tues): plan / Next research / Trip to Korea / Teaching 
	- Hair (12/4 Thurs.)
	- Gifts: Chocolate (12/5 Fri.)
2. Design simulation 
	2.1) Fix Beta=1 (Only 1 attribute-Price)/ Fix p&q and generate alpha/ Predict the price at the 2nd stage / if that is cheaper->postponed
3. Unit test - objective fn / gradient / exact Hessian calculation / Exponential smoothing / sampling error
4. Functions to add: 
	4.1) ComputeEstimatesVariance
	4.2) Hessian approximation: SR1 / BFGS
	4.3) Argument option - Hessian update / Control constraints
	4.4) Print results(at each iteration) / Write to files
5. Paper - Add to progress reports
6. Meeting schedule
