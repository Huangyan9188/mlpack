MLPACK is the first comprehensive scalable machine learning library.
Developed by the Fundamental Algorithmic and Statistical Tools
laboratory (FASTlab), MLPACK and its core functions library FASTlib
are the much needed filling of an existing void. Previously,
researchers had to either (a) settle for poorly-scaling collections of
methods implemented for academic purposes, (b) hunt down the often
difficult to find and difficult to apply yet fast code writen by
algorithms' developers, or (c) reimplement solutions to their specific
analysis problems from scratch. With MLPACK, we offer a fourth option,
in which researchers may find all the methods they need designed
favoring both speed and usability.

1. CONTENTS
-----------

MLPACK currently includes the following algorithms:

- allknn - A dual tree based $k$-nearest neighbor classifier using
kd-trees.

- allnn - A dual-tree based $k$-nearest neighbor classifier using
kd-trees, optimized for $k = 1$.

- fastica - Implements the FastICA Algorithm for Independent Component
Analysis using fixed-point optimization with various
independence-minded contrast functions.

- hmm - Implements 3 types of Hidden Markov Models: discrete, gaussian
and mixture of gaussians.

- infomax_ica - Implements the Information Maximisation algorithm for
Independent Component Analysis.

- kalman - Implements of the Kalman filter ensuring the positive
definiteness of the error covariance matrices by using QR and Cholesky
factorizations in both the measurement and time update steps.

- kde - Implements the following versions of kernel density
estimation: Using depth first dual tree, multidimensional fast fourier
transform, multidimensional fast gaussian transform and
multidimensional improved fast gaussian transform.

- mog - Implements parametric estimation of a mixture of Gaussians
using two different loss functions - maximum likelihood and the L2
error.

- naive_bayes - Implements the Naive Bayes Classifier.

- optimization - Implements two optimizers - The Nelder-Mead algorithm
and the Quasi-Newton algorithm.

- series_expansion - Implements the series expansion needed for the
fast $N$-body algorithm. Gaussian series expansion in $O(D^p)$ and
$O(p^D)$ are implemented. 

- svm - Implements the Support Vector Machine classifier and
regression. Includes the Sequential Minimial Optimization algorithm.

All algorithms are available in both executable and linkable form.

2. HOWTO
--------

2.1. Quick start
----------------

The CMake build system has been tested to work on Linux or Windows XP/Vista
under Cygwin using gcc4 and gcc3.4.  It will probably work on Mac OSX using gcc
also.  In the future, we will test it under the other build systems that CMake
supports, like Visual Studio and Eclipse, but for now a gcc/make development
environment is your best bet.  

1. Use the Cygwin installer or your Linux package manager to install:

* gcc
* g++
* g77 or gfortran (cmake wants a Fortran compiler--make it happy)
* make
* cmake 2.6 or higher
* BLAS & LAPACK (usually separate in Linux, both included as "lapack" under
  "Math" in the Cygwin installer)

Optional, but strongly recommended:

* The Boost C++ libraries


2. Extract the tar or zip file, mlpack-0.1-distribution.tar.gz.  Let's say
you've just created /path/to/fastlib2 (it's the directory this file is in)

3. After this, you will need to make sure your environment variables are set up
properly. Set FASTLIBPATH to this directory, e.g.

export FASTLIBPATH=/path/to/fastlib2  (bash)
setenv FASTLIBPATH=/path/to/fastlib2  (csh/tcsh)

4. Change to the fastlib subdirectory and create a build directory:

cd $FASTLIBPATH/fastlib
mkdir build  (this can actually go anywhere you want)
cd build

5. CMake's default is to install things in /usr/local/, which may not be what
you want.  So, let's configure our cmake project:

% ccmake .. (if in build subdir)
% ccmake $FASTLIBPATH/fastlib  (if you put the build dir some weird place)

This will bring up a curses interface (GUIs exist for cmake; feel free to
install one).  Hit "c" to configure.  You should see a screen like this:

 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                *                                             
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX            */usr/local                                   

Eventually lots of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE's will be supported.  For now just leave
this blank.  One choice for the install prefix that will make things similar to
the old build system is to use FASTLIBPATH as the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  This
will pust the libraries and header files in the lib/ and include/
subdirectories.  So, go to the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX line, hit Enter, change it
to whatever you want, and hit Enter again.  Hit "c" to update the
configuration, then hit "g" to generate the build files and exit.  There should
now be a Makefile in the build directory.  Now run

% make
% make install

Let's assume you installed things to $FASTLIBPATH.  If you look in
$FASTLIBPATH/lib and $FASTLIBPATH/include, you should see a static library and
a bunch of header files.  At this point, you should be able to develop your
code using whatever tools you want.

6. Quick Test

For instance, let's test out the install by compiling one of the mlpack
programs by hand:

% cd $FASTLIBPATH/mlpack/allnn
% g++ allnn_test.cc -o allnn_test -DDISABLE_DISK_MATRIX -L$FASTLIBPATH/lib -I$FASTLIBPATH/include -lfastlib -llapack
% ./allnn_test (tests should pass)

That "-DDISABLE_DISK_MATRIX" is an annoying define that you'll have to add
until we add support for the memory manager to the CMake build.

7. Compiling MLPACK code with CMake

% cd $FASTLIBPATH/mlpack
% mkdir build && cd build
% ccmake ..

Hit 'c' to configure.
You have to tell CMake where to find the fastlib you just installed.  By
default, it looks in /usr/local, so it won't find the library.  Change 
FASTLIB_BASE_DIR to where you installed fastlib (e.g. the path in $FASTLIBPATH)
and hit 'c' again.  FASTLIB_LIB should now be correct.  Hit 'g' to generate the
Makefiles.

% make

This builds libraries and executables for each algorithm in its corresponding
subdirectory.  You can run the programs from there.  There is no sensible 
'make install' target yet.

One easy(ish) way to develop your code would be to make a subdirectory for it
in mlpack.  Then you could copy and modify the CMakeLists.txt file from another
subdirectory to create your libraries and executables.  You also have to modify
the CMakeLists.txt file in the mlpack directory to recurse into your
subdirectory.  Then, when you configure mlpack, it will also create make
targets for your code.

Happy coding!
