TylesBase installation directions.

Library
=======
Installation requires

   ocaml
   findlib
   ocamldsort
   extLib

Let <tylesBase> refer to the source directory. Do

    cd <tylesBase>
    make all

This will generate the files tylesBase.cm{o,a}. These will be under
the <tylesBase>/_build/src directory, and you can link to them there.

Documentation
=============
To make the documentation do

   cd <tylesBase>
   make doc

This produces documentation in html format. The root is
<tylesBase>/html/index.html.
