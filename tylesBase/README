TylesBase is a library that is internally used by a few other
projects. It is not meant to be distributed on its own.

Design
======
File names suffixed with a "2"
- These are extensions of other libraries, currently either the
  Standard Library or ExtLib.
- This is done because it's not possible to for example name a file
  list.ml. The compiler complains.

Files not named with a "2"
- These are new modules that we want to include in TylesBase.

tylesBase.ml
- Packs all the modules.
- Cannot use -pack option because we need to change the names of
  modules named with a "2".
- Also I don't know if you could extend Pervasives with -pack, which
  is also done.

Usage
=====
- Intended usage is to do "open TylesBase", which effectively makes
  TylesBase your standard library.
- Do not use modules directly, i.e. do not use List2, use
  TylesBase.List. Ideally, we will be able to make this impossible.
