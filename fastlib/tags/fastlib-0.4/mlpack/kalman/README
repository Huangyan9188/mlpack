Method: Kalman Filter

Implementation:
A numerically robust implementation to ensure positive definiteness of the 
error covariance matrices is employed. This is achieved through the use of the 
QR and Cholesky factorizations in both the measurement and time update steps.

How to use the executable

1. At Matlab's command prompt, type  test_kf (m-file) to generate system 
matrices and user-defined params (an example of these files are already 
in this folder). 

The plant/ system that the Kalman filter is interacting with is assumed to be 
a linear dynamical system for which the Kalman filter is performing state 
estimation/ prediction.
 
Matlab will stop and control will be given to the keyboard

2. Compile by typing fl-build kalman_main
 
3. Execute by typing ./kalman_main

4. At Matlab's prompt, type dbcont

Results will be loaded into Matlab for plotting, etc. Results showing a 
comparison between Matlab's and Fastlib's implementation will be displayed.
