DATA GENERATION

1) construct N orthogonal curves of length T
     e.g.: e1(t) = sqrt(2) * sin(pi*x)
           e2(t) = sqrt(2) * cos(pi*x)

2) generate M x N scores:
   for each of N curves
       draw M scores from a Laplacian distribution

3) compose M data points


ALGORITHM

1) start with some random assignment of weights for a B-vector (B = 2)
