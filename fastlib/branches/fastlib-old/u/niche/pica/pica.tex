\title{Positive ICA}

\begin{document}

Let $X$ be a set of points in $\mathbf{R}^n$. We want to find a decomposition of $X$ into linear combinations of independent components. This is the matrix factorization problem $X = A S$, for positive mixing matrix $A$ and positive sources $S$. 
$X \in \mathbf{R}^N$

model: $X = A S$

$\tilde{X} = Z X$ for whitening matrix $Z$ (note that $\tilde{X}$ is not centered).

We want to find some
$Y = W \tilde{X} = W Z X = V X$ ($\Rightarrow X = V^{-1} Y$)

such that $Y$ has minimum sum marginal entropy under constraints that $V^{-1}$ and $Y$ are positive (nonnegative)



Plumbley's nonnegative ICA is globally converges onto the independent components if they are well-grounded. What if they are not well-grounded?

Can we quantify the number of nonnegative matrix factorization candidate solutions? How many rotations satisfy the positivity constraint
