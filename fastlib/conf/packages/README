In order to check in new packaging source, use the svn-inject command.  It
can be used with the FASTLAB repository in the following manner, assuming
you DO NOT want to store the upstream source in the repository.  If you
do this, you need to provide a watch file and get-orig-source target in the
rules file, so anyone who checks out the packaging can build the package.

Alternatively or complimentary to the get-orig-source target, consider using
a helper script found in the debian folder with the watch file.  This way,
the person trying to replicate your package can use
uscan --download-current-version to get the original source tarball, and
automated scripts will know how to put that source tarball in the right
place to built the package.

svn-inject -o --no-branches /path/to/<package>_<version>.dsc http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/fastlib/conf/packages/
