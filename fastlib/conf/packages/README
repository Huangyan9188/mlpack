In order to check in new packaging source, use the svn-inject command.  It
can be used with the FASTLAB repository in the following manner, assuming
you DO NOT want to store the upstream source in the repository.  If you
do this, you need to provide a watch file and get-orig-source target in the
rules file, so anyone who checks out the packaging can build the package.

"-c 2" checks out the entire package source tree, not just trunk.  Omission
will not check the source out by default.

svn-inject -o -c 2 --no-branches /path/to/<package>_<version>.dsc http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/fastlib/conf/packages/
