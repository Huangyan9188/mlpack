1 Test smoothing parameter quality
select random subset of data to estimate unmixing matrix
select random subset of data to test independence



take an IC
observe entropy

smooth the IC (try using a linear approximation)
observe entropy



 


given raw data that may require smoothing:
      smooth until joint entropy stops increasing or smoothness no longer well describes the test data: We obtain smooth components from training data and observe the sum of functional dot products for the test data. If this sum is less than the sum for less smooth data, consider using the last iteration of the (slightly more rough) data.
      


training and test coefficients for constructing data from basis curves
are basis functions orthogonal?


for training data, we have the coefficients that compose the curves
for test data, we have the coe

pc_coef = pc_coef';
data_coef = data_coef';


scores = zeros(N,p);
for j = 1:p
  pc_coef_j = pc_coef(j,:);

  for i = 1:N
    scores(i,j) = sum(sum((data_coef(i,:)' * pc_coef_j) .* pen));
  end
end




score = 0;
for j = 1:p_small
  for i = 1:N
    for k = 1:30
      score = score + data_coef(i,k) * pc_coef(j,k);
  end
end




LATEST THING TO DO:
construct autoregressive functions s_j(t) = a * s_j(t-1) + r, r ~ N(0,R)
smooth using moving average: \tilde{s}_j = MA(s_j)
construct mixture of data x_i(t) = \sum_{j=1}^p b_{i,j} s_j(t) + q, q ~ N(0,Q)

1) test fPCA
 a) run fPCA does with different settings of lambda (lamda = alpha^i, for i \in {0, 1, ..., 10} and alpha = 0.9
 b) choose the optimal labmda via cross-validation on the test set of the sum of squares of the inner products of the fPC's with the data curves

2) see how well other ICA algorithms are able to extract the independent component functions




for event-related potential data, are the extracted components interesting
    so far, the answer is no

what are applications where the proposed model does make sense?

for a mixing model where there exist a small number of sources and many more mixtures than sources

each observation is a mixture of many sources

if one object emits a constant signal and a microphone stochastically picks up the object as it appears in different areas of a room


The examples where functional PCA is able to show interesting results
