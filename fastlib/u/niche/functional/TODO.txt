1 Test smoothing parameter quality
select random subset of data to estimate unmixing matrix
select random subset of data to test independence



take an IC
observe entropy

smooth the IC (try using a linear approximation)
observe entropy



 


given raw data that may require smoothing:
      smooth until joint entropy stops increasing or smoothness no longer well describes the test data: We obtain smooth components from training data and observe the sum of functional dot products for the test data. If this sum is less than the sum for less smooth data, consider using the last iteration of the (slightly more rough) data.
      


training and test coefficients for constructing data from basis curves
are basis functions orthogonal?


for training data, we have the coefficients that compose the curves
for test data, we have the coe

pc_coef = pc_coef';
data_coef = data_coef';


scores = zeros(N,p);
for j = 1:p
  pc_coef_j = pc_coef(j,:);

  for i = 1:N
    scores(i,j) = sum(sum((data_coef(i,:)' * pc_coef_j) .* pen));
  end
end
