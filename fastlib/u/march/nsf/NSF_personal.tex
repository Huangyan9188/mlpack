%NSF Fellows are expected to become knowledge experts and leaders who can contribute significantly to research, education, and innovations in science and engineering. The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate your potential to satisfy this requirement. Your ideas and examples do not have to be confined necessarily to the discipline that you have chosen to pursue. 

%Describe any personal, professional, or educational experiences or situations that have prepared you or contributed to your desire to pursue advanced study in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Describe your competencies and evidence of leadership potential. Discuss your career aspirations and how the NSF fellowship will enable you to achieve your goals. 

Grad school is a big opportunity.  Can read and think all the time, etc.  Don't talk about being young, it's cliche.  

Long standing interest in science, course work drifted away but interest remained.  Now have opportunity to bring experience to bear on science from an important angle: scientific computing.  


Experiences:

TA - teaching, education, communication - need to be clear
	Lots of experience with explaining technical things to non-technical audience
	Teaching linear algebra to uninterested freshmen who don't see why it's important
	
Fraternity president
	leadership, setting goals, teamwork, organization
	



Career goals:

Want to make computing and mathematics accessible to scientists.  Requires ability to learn a lot of technical things, communicate scientific ideas and computational ideas back and forth.  
Teaching is also an important part of this, since something. . .
